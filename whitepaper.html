        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Degen Trader by DegenDAO ($DDAO) is the native token of DegenDAO, an ambitious
          project designed to bridge the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and
          traditional trading floors. 
          <br><br>
          By leveraging the expertise of professional traders and
          the power of decentralized governance, DegenDAO aims to provide token holders
          with stable base rewards and opportunities for enhanced profits through strategic
          participation in trading performance.

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
          To create a decentralized trading floor where token holders can benefit from 
          the profits of professional trading while retaining governance rights and 
          staking opportunities. 
          <br><br>
          Degen Trader by DegenDAO aims to democratize access 
          to trading profits, making professional trading strategies accessible to everyone.

      <!-- slide 4: key features -->
      <div class="wp-slide">
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        
        <h4>Creator Bid Treasury</h4>
        <p>
          The Creator Bid Treasury will serve as the financial backbone of Degen Trader 
          by DegenDAO, funding a team of professional traders. Treasury funds will be 
          deployed into diverse trading strategies to generate monthly profits (PnL). 
          These profits will be distributed between voters, the trader, and the treasury.
        </p>

        <h4>Staking and Rewards</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Base APR:</strong> A stable, predictable annual percentage rate for staking tokens.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance-Based Rewards:</strong> By voting on specific traders, token holders can potentially increase their rewards based on monthly PnL.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Trader Profiles and Voting</h4>
        <p>
          Each trader will have a detailed profile that includes their strategy, risk level, 
          and expected returns. Token holders vote on the traders they wish to support, 
          aligning with strategies that match their risk appetite and reward goals.
        </p>

        <h4>Professional Trading Team</h4>
        <p>
          Degen Trader by DegenDAO will operate like a traditional trading floor, 
          employing multiple traders to diversify treasury funds. Traders are funded 
          monthly from the treasury based on performance, with top performers 
          gaining access to greater capital.
