Hello!
I'm looking to build a website for my crypto currency project. The website will be simple, and include; about our token, a plan for the future of the project (roadmap), a link to buy the token on exchange, links to social media, a section for the whitepaper (mission statement), and two coming soon sections (apply to be a trader and staking rewards section). There will be no sophisticated functionality. I'm not sure if you can integrate a live chart into the website for the token but that would be great too.
The name of our company is DegenDAO. The name of the token is Degen Trader by DegenDAO ($DDAO) We like a black heavy theme.

Please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to work on.
